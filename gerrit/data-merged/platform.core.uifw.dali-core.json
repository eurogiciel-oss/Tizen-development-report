creating/destroying SceneGraph::Animators each time the target object is connected/disconnected from the stage\n - Removed use of boost::function for animator functions\n\n[Problem]  AnimatorConnector

object is disconnected.\n[Cause]    n/a\n[Solution] AnimatorConnector creates a SceneGraph::Animator once and notifies to it whenever the target object is connected/disconnected.\n           SceneGraph::Animation will only remove Animators when the target object has been destroyed.\n\nChange-Id:

loss and regain\n\n[Problem]  Dali doesn\u0027t handle context loss\n[Cause]    Context loss code, e.g. ReplaceSurface(), has never been tested,\nbut is required for new platforms.\n\n[Solution] Allow the application to choose either to handle context\nloss itself (i.e.  it should connect to the new stage signals\nContextLost and ContextRegained), or to let Dali handle context loss\n( which means it needs to retain bitmap data and mesh data, adding a\nmemory overhead )\n\nFor Tizen, if the application doesn\u0027t handle context loss, DALi only\nactually needs to retain the mesh data, as it can reload bitmaps from\nfile based images (No other bitmap type is discardable).\n\nIt also triggers a reload of the font atlas, although that should be\nrelatively quick, as the glyphs have already been cached, so it should\nbe as quick as resizing texture atlas.\n\nIt also triggers a refresh of all render tasks with framebuffers and RefreshOnce.\n\nFor controls and applications that delete their render tasks after they have finished\nrendering, they will need to listen for ContextRegained in order to re-run them to\nrecreate the resultant framebuffer.\n\nAdded tests for mesh data discard using public meshes and meshes loaded via model.\n\nChange-Id: I0d89f0dee2dfcf79fcabce19c36ac129de077fa8\nSigned-off-by: David Steele
