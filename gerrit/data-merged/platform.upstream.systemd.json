The chips\nprovide four \"hardware\" partitions.  The first is /dev/mmcblk0, it\ntakes almost whole space and holds a GPT with several real partitions\n(/dev/mmcblk0p?). Then there are three block devices (mmcblk0boot0,\nmmcblk0boot1, rpmb) that are part of the same hardware as mmcblk0 that\nare presented by the kernel as children of the latter. That relationship\nmakes gpt-auto-generator try to peek them but since they are not GPT\npartitions blkid_do_safeprobe() returns -2 making verify_gpt_parition()\nfunction return -ENODEV.\n\nOrigin: backport, http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id\u003d843f737a\nChange-Id: Ica3f4f02437a92d2b970d8007c4ac60f35906937\nSigned-off-by: Patrick McCarty \u003cpatrick.mccarty@linux.intel.com\u003e\n","createdOn":1389998157,"lastUpdated":1390589913,"sortKey":"002aaa9200003bcb","open":false,"status":"MERGED","comments":[{"timestamp":1389998157,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick McCarty","email":"patrick.mccarty@intel.com","username":"pmccarty"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1390217797,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Stelmach","email":"l.stelmach@samsung.com","username":"lstelmach"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1\n\n(2 comments)"},{"timestamp":1390218238,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Stelmach","email":"l.stelmach@samsung.com","username":"lstelmach"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1 comment)"},{"timestamp":1390259257,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick McCarty","email":"patrick.mccarty@intel.com","username":"pmccarty"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1 comment)"},{"timestamp":1390259584,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick McCarty","email":"patrick.mccarty@intel.com","username":"pmccarty"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 2."},{"timestamp":1390296528,"reviewer":{"name":"Lukasz Stelmach","email":"l.stelmach@samsung.com","username":"lstelmach"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1"},{"timestamp":1390588131,"reviewer":{"name":"william douglas","email":"william.douglas@intel.com","username":"wdouglas"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2"},{"timestamp":1390589898,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick McCarty","email":"patrick.mccarty@intel.com","username":"pmccarty"},"message":"Patch Set 2: Verified+1"},{"timestamp":1390589913,"reviewer":{"name":"Patrick McCarty","email":"patrick.mccarty@intel.com","username":"pmccarty"},"message":"Change has been successfully merged into the git repository."}]}
